# NHS Digital Therapy Assistant

## Summary
An open-source conversational AI tool designed to provide initial occupational therapy self-assessment and guidance for NHS patients. The system would ask structured, clinically validated questions, flag urgent cases, and direct patients to appropriate NHS services.

## Problem
NHS occupational therapy services face long waiting lists, and patients often have no structured way to assess their needs while waiting. Early self-assessment can help prioritise high-need cases and reduce unnecessary delays.

## Proposed Solution
- Fine-tuned open-source large language model (LLM) trained on validated OT assessment frameworks.
- On-device or secure NHS-hosted deployment to maintain patient privacy.
- Integration with NHS service directories and booking systems.
- Accessible via web, mobile, and voice-enabled interfaces.

## Impact
- Reduced referral-to-assessment times.
- More consistent and equitable triage.
- Improved patient engagement and self-awareness.
