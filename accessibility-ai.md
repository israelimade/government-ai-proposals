# Accessibility AI for Government Services

## Summary
An AI-powered accessibility layer for gov.uk services, designed to adapt content, navigation, and user interfaces to individual accessibility needs.

## Problem
Many government digital services are not fully accessible to users with disabilities, creating barriers to essential services.

- Dynamic adaptation of page layouts, font sizes, contrast, and navigation flow.
- Text-to-speech and speech-to-text integration for improved accessibility.
- Open-source implementation to ensure transparency and adaptability.

## Impact
- Greater inclusion for disabled citizens.
- Compliance with accessibility legislation.
- Increased usability of government digital services.
